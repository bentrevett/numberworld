# Task-Oriented Language Grounding

*"To perform tasks specified by natural language instructions, autonomous  agents  need  to  extract  semantically  meaning- ful  representations  of  language  and  map  it  to  visual  elements and actions in the environment. This problem is called task-oriented  language  grounding"* - [Gated-Attention Architectures for Task-Oriented Language Grounding

--- 

This repo. contains a toy environment for task-oriented language grounding, aimed at being used with reinforcement learning.
